# pet-shop
Final project for my Web Development for Mobile and Desktop Certificate.
This is a PHP based web application for a ficticious pet grooming shop.  The goal of the project is to hightlight my knowledge of PHP, HTML, JavaScript, jQuery, and MySQL.  In addition, this project utilized XAMPP and GIT. 

#Features
1. Contact Us form that sends an email.
2. HTML form for site visitors to create a grooming appointment.  This data is pushed to a MySQL database.
3. A backend admin page to view, edit, delete, and create new entries in the database.
